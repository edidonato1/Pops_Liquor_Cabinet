Friday 10.9
-----
- Established connection with API

- Established navigation pathways between components
- Created alphabetized drop-down for GrabBottle component
- Isolated target value of GrabBottle drop-down selection


- Started working on UpdateBottle component to be nested in GrabBottle component


Saturday 10.10
----- 

 - Pass {GrabBottle} value through useEffect function to select bottle and update DOM render
  
- Grab grab props from GrabBottle to pass to UpdateBottle
   - Can I edit the data this way, or will the UpdateBottle component need to be built in GrabBottle?

- Need to establish axios post request to update Amount value of selected item
  -  This will likely be done through a counter button in the UI
  - props will tell UpdateBottle which bottle it is manipulating, it will pass this back into a 
      useEffect() API post request, which will update the amount whenever the 
      state of {amount} changes. 
- If the state of {amount} is zero, and the user navigates away from the page, the bottle will be 
  removed from the API
  - A conditional delete request is needed for this to happen.  When the user navigates from the page, 
    or in other words an  unMount() ( will need to look back into the proper method for this ), the 
    user will receive an alert that will ask them if they would like to remove the bottle from the 
    liquor cabinet.

- Let's also get started on the AddBottle form and put request tomorrow.
  - Model it after the Audubon bird form.
  - If this works well, maybe integrate the Cocktail Recipe database right away.
