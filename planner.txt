Friday 10.9
-----

- Established connection with API
- Completed core function of Inventory page
- Established navigation pathways between components
- Created alphabetized drop-down for GrabBottle component
- Isolated target value of GrabBottle drop-down selection
- Started working on UpdateBottle component to be nested in GrabBottle component


Saturday 10.10
----- 

- Passed GrabBottle to UpdateBottle through props
  - Able to update current bottle, but State is one step behind
  - State also keeps the value of the first bottle that was selected in the dropdown, but won't 
    update when a new bottle is selected.  
      - The newly selected bottle updates in the UpdateBottle component, but inherits the state of
        the previously edited bottle.
      - State is being passed down through props by GrabBottle, but isn't updating 

- AddBottle component seems to be in perfect working order - consider styling 

- UpdateBottle also doesn't trigger a re-render for Inventory.  Page needs to be refreshed.
  - AddBottle does however automatically update Inventory without refresh



Sunday 10.11

- Finish reworking UpdateBottle component. If successful: 
  - If the state of {amount} is zero, and the user navigates away from the page, the bottle will be 
    removed from the API
    - A conditional delete request is needed for this to happen.  When the user navigates from the page, 
      or in other words an  unMount() ( will need to look back into the proper method for this ), the 
      user will receive an alert that will ask them if they would like to remove the bottle from the 
      liquor cabinet.


- Since Add Bottle worked pretty easily, maybe integrate the Cocktail Recipe database right away.
  - Could be something to focus on other than styling while we work out the rest of the kinks
    thoughout the site.  Will likely need help from Shay
